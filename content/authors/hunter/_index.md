I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/bjhlab/" target="_blank">The Harvey Lab</a> and the <a href="http://www.thebutmanlab.com/" target="_blank">Ecosystem Biogeochemistry Group</a> in School of Environmental and Forest Science at the University of Washington, and current Graduate Research Fellow with the National Science Foundation. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of disturbance, landscape, and ecosystem ecology though I am broadly interested in integrating field studies and "big data" to solve pressing issues in forest management and ecology. My current work involves quantifying forest structural restoration needs in the Pacific Northwest, specifically detecting and attributing multidecadal changes in the "ecological departure" of forest landscapes in the region. I am also leading efforts to advance understanding of the consequences of disturbance, climate, and management legacies on temperate forest demography and biomass dynamics across multiple scales.

I am the lead author and maintainer of <a href="https://rfia.netlify.com" target="_blank">rFIA</a>, an R package designed to increase the accessibility and use of the USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Database.
