I am a graudate student in the <a href="http://blue.for.msu.edu/" target="_blank">Geospatial Lab</a> in the Department of Foresty at Michigan State University, and a current Graduate Research Fellow with the National Science Foundation. I am also the lead author and maintainer of <a href="https://rfia.netlify.com" target="_blank">rFIA</a>, an R package designed to unlock the national Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) database in R. 

I am broadly interested in applied ecological research and forest management, though my specific research interests lie at the intersection of disturbance, landscape, and ecosystem ecology. Beginning in 2020, I plan to pursue a PhD in Forest Science & Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management.
