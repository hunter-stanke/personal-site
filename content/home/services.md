**I help firms leverage data (big and small) and analytics to improve their decision making processes**. Many of my clients come from the forest products industry and natural climate solutions space, and I particularly enjoy drawing on my background in forestry to design solutions to environmental and resource management problems. 

My services include, but are not limited to: 

  - R programming (scripting, package development, automation)
  - Statistical modeling and ML model development
  - Forest inventory/ biometrics
  - Data management
  - Technical writing and editing
  - Data visualization

**As the lead author and maintainer of the <a href="https://rfia.netlify.app" target="_blank">rFIA R package</a>, I have developed unique expertise and familiarity with the <a href="https://www.fia.fs.fed.us/" target="_blank">USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Database</a>.** The FIA Database is among the richest ecological datasets in the world, with primary applications in forest health monitoring, carbon accounting, remote sensing, and broad-scale timber product monitoring. Despite being publicly available, complexity in database structure, data coding, and sampling design make the FIA Database extremely difficult to access - even for experienced users.
