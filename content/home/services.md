Interested in using the USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Database in your work, but lost on where to start? Contact me with your specific project needs, and see how I can help!

The FIA Database is among the richest ecological datasets in the world, with primary applications in forest health monitoring, carbon accounting, remote sensing, and broad-scale timber product monitoring. Despite being publicly available, complexity in database structure, data coding, and sampling design make the FIA Database extremely difficult to access - even for experienced users. 

As the lead author and maintainer of the <a href="https://rfia.netlify.app" target="_blank">rFIA R package</a>, I have spent countless hours trudging through the depths of the FIA Database - improving access to FIA's existing capacity and developing new, improved methods for estimation and forest health evaluation. With this experience in hand, I offer a wide variety of data and analytic services for organizations interested in using FIA data to improve their own work. Contact me to see how I can help!
