Accordingly, forestry professionals are increasingly tasked with protecting and improving forest health across vast, complex landscapes. However important, such efforts are often immensely challenging to implement. Prior to engaging in active management, systems must be developed to accurately monitor forests across broad spatial domains, detect underlying changes in forest condition, and attribute such change to a host of potential, interacting forest stressors. As such, the development of user-friendly technologies that help streamline forest health evaluation and monitoring may be of extraordinary value to forestry professionals tasked with maintaining the health, diversity, and productivity of North American forests. To this end, we developed rFIA, an open-source R package aimed at increasing the accessibility and use of the USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Database. We demonstrate the utility of rFIA for broad-scale forest health evaluation and monitoring via a series of case studies. First, we highlight rFIA’s spatio-temporal estimation capacity by estimating current down woody material biomass within HUC 6 watershed boundaries across the conterminous U.S. (CONUS). Second, we illustrate how rFIA enhances the value of FIA for temporal change detection by examining trends in lodgepole pine (*Pinus contorta*) mortality in Colorado using multiple design-based estimators. Third, we use rFIA to estimate annual change in live tree carbon at all remeasured FIA plots across the CONUS, and develop a Bayesian hierarchical estimate the degree to which forest disturbances have driven such change. We envision rFIA as a key component in the future of forest health evaluation and monitoring in the US, targeting expansion in small area estimation and the development of long-term monitoring and reporting tools.","tags":null,"title":"Advancing broad-scale forest health evaluation and monitoring with rFIA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hunter Stanke","Andrew O Finley","Grant M Domke","Aaron S Weed","David M Macfarlane"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1587945600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587945600,"objectID":"3b80473f94207ec2ead40ee677154d1e","permalink":"/publication/fsi_natcomm/","publishdate":"2020-12-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fsi_natcomm/","section":"publication","summary":"The nature of forest disturbances are changing, yet consequences for forest dynamics remain uncertain.

FIA hosts one of the largest ecological datasets in the world, though its complexity limits access for many potential users. \\texttt{rFIA} is an R package designed to simplify the estimation of forest attributes using data collected by the FIA Program. Specifically, \\texttt{rFIA} improves access to the spatio-temporal estimation capacity of the FIA Database via space-time indexed summaries of forest variables within user-defined population boundaries. The package implements multiple design-based estimators, and has been validated against official estimates and sampling errors produced by the FIA Program. The package has been made open-source is freely available for download from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. In recent decades, forests of the western US have experienced unprecedented change in climate and forest disturbance regimes, and widespread shifts in forest composition, structure, and function are expected in response. However, large-scale, comprehensive assessments of tree population performance have yet to be conducted in the region. We develop an index of forest population performance based on repeated censuses of field plots, and apply this index to assess the status of the most abundant tree species in the western US. Our study provides empirical evidence to suggest tree species in the western US are exhibiting strong divergence in population performance, with over half (70\\%) of species experiencing range-wide population decline. We found spatial variation in population performance across the ranges of all species, indicating range shifts are already underway. Our results further indicate that species decline can seldom be attributed to a single forest disturbance agent, highlighting the importance of considering multiple risks factors in broad-scale forest management.","tags":[],"title":"Unlocking the Forest Inventory and Analysis Database: Applications to Nation-Wide Forest Health Monitoring","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Hunter Stanke","Andrew O.

While many previous studies have investigated the primary controls of river corridor exchange, contradictory relationships between controls and exchange responses have been reported in the literature and are likely a result of small sample sizes and methodological inconsistencies across studies. In this study, we present a large-scale, systematic investigation of the controls of river corridor exchange across the naturally occurring gradient of geologic and hydrologic conditions of a common river network. We conducted conservative solute tracer tests across a diversity of geomorphic and hydrologic conditions and used a basic time series analysis to describe solute transit time distributions. We then used generalized linear models and multiple machine learning techniques to predict time series with respect to remotely sensed topographic and surface water concavity indices. To determine how performance may improve by increasing observations, we simulated a large dataset and measured model performance along a gradient of sample size. Results of linear modelling exposed weak relationships between predictor and response variables, although explanatory power varied considerably with respect to response variable predicted. While predictive capacity remained poor, it appeared that hydrologic indices contributed disproportionately to explanatory power of top models.  In comparing results of various machine learning and linear modelling approaches, we found no significant difference in performance among techniques. The low predictive power observed in our modelling efforts indicates a high degree of variability in exchange flux and transient storage not well explained by our existing suite of topographic, surface water concavity, and basic hydrologic indices. Results of our simulation efforts indicate that expansion of the existing dataset may lead to improved model performance in future studies.","tags":[],"title":"Vertical Stream Concavity as a Predictor of Solute Transport Behavior in Mountain Headwater Streams","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Hunter Stanke","Sonja Christensen","Jonathan Cook","William Porter","David Williams"],"categories":null,"content":" Recieved Best Student Poster Award (poster adapted from attached slides).

The spatial distribution of the disease at the landscape level is associated with movement and space use patterns of white-tailed deer. Using least cost path analyses and spatial land cover data, we evaluated the composition and connectivity of white-tailed deer habitat between locations where CWD positive deer have been harvested in Michigan. We constructed a resistance surface of the affected region based on land cover type, forest density, and road density as these factors are known to influence space use patterns of deer. We then examined the relative connectivity between points of CWD occurrence by performing least cost path analyses between all possible point combinations, and ranking each associated cost to a respective distribution produced by sampling the landscape surrounding each point of origin. Results of this analysis showed that eastbound paths tended to rank significantly lower than westbound paths, and the relative rank of paths was unrelated to total path distance. These findings suggest that deer within the study area are more likely to move in an eastward direction across the landscape. As the spread of CWD is strongly associated with deer movement patterns, this result also suggests that a disease source is likely to be present West of the study area, and that the disease is likely to have spread eastward from this source. This predicted direction of spread is opposite that in which the disease has been detected on the landscape over time. Therefore, to effectively manage the disease, a significant increase in disease monitoring resources should be focused on the Western edge of the study area. Further sampling within this area may prove critical in gaining insight to the true state of the disease in Michigan.","tags":[],"title":"Connecting the Dots: A Landscape Approach for Michigan CWD","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Traditional methods to assess landscape connectivity often fail to address functional connectivity, that is they fail to consider the behavioral patterns and movement ecology of the species of interest.

In dry inland forests of the PNW, novel forest conditions (e.g., abundance of high density, closed-canopy forests dominated by fire-intolerant species) have interacted with changing climate to incite rapid increases in disturbance activity. In contrast, the moister forests west of the cascade crest have been shaped by a century and a half of industrial forest management, resulting in landscape fragmentation (e.g., checkerboard patterning), simplification of forest structure (e.g., predominance of early and mid-seral plantation settings, lack of coarse wood), and loss of late-seral conditions across a broad spatial domain. While patterns of change differ strongly between dry and moist forests of the PNW, reversion of landscape composition (e.g., relative abundance of community types), structure (e.g., seral-stage distributions), and function (e.g., fire regimes, nutrient cycling) towards historically ``stable\u0026rdquo; conditions is broadly assumed to increase forest resilience to future changes in disturbance regimes and environmental drivers. As such, agencies tasked with managing public forestland in the western US have broadly adopted principles of ecological restoration and landscape-scale management, and face the immense challenge of increasing the pace and scale of forest restoration in the midst of changing disturbance regimes, climate, and societal values.\nPrevious studies have sought to support forest restoration efforts by quantifying structural restoration needs and determining where, how much, and what forms of treatment are required to shift the structure of present-day forest landscapes to meet historically \u0026ldquo;stable\u0026rdquo; conditions across the PNW. However, these studies have been unable to quantify the uncertainty associated with their estimates of restoration need, nor the the accuracy of their approach in characterizing current vegetation at broad spatial scales. In the context of decision-making, proper quantification of uncertainty (e.g., in the form of confidence/credible intervals) is often as important as point estimation; the range of credible estimates of forest restoration need is of no less value than our \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo; estimate and should be quantified whenever possible. Further, previous studies have aimed to characterize forest restoration needs at single points in time, and thus have not provided a mechanism to detect statistically significant change in restoration needs or quantify the relative importance of disturbance and successional processes in driving such change. It is reasonable to expect that the composition and structure of forested landscapes have changed considerably over recent decades in the PNW, in light of increased wildfire activity and recent outbreaks of native insects in the region. In many cases, disturbances may contribute to forest restoration objectives directly (e.g., \u0026ldquo;restoration wildfire\u0026rdquo; in the dry domain), and as such, quantifying the patterns and underlying drivers of change in forest structural restoration need is a key challenge for ecological research.\nHere, we propose a re-evaluation of forest structural restoration needs in the PNW under a design-based setting (i.e., as opposed to a model-based as used previously). Specifically, we seek to (1) generate unbiased, annual estimates of forest structural stage distributions and associated uncertainty using the FIA Database over the period 2002-2019; (2) compare design-based (i.e., FIA) and model-based (i.e, GNN) estimates of restoration need to determine the “accuracy” of model-based summaries; (3) draw on remeasured FIA plots to derive an estimator of average annual change in forest restoration need over the last two decades in the PNW.\n\nResearch Questions  Do design-based and model-based estimates of restoration need differ in a systematic manner?\n Does the magnitude of divergence in restoration need predicted under each paradigm vary across space and/or by type of treatment needed? What stand structural stages are primarily responsible for driving divergence in restoration need, and what does this indicate about prediction uncertainty of the model-based estimator At what spatial scales do estimates of structural stage distributions and/or restoration needs diverge, if ever?   How have forest structural restoration needs changed over the last 20 years in the Pacific Northwest?\n How have natural disturbances (i.e., fire, insect outbreaks, disease, and wind), silvicultural treatments, and succession to contributed to such change? When, where, and to what degree have natural disturbances and succession contributed directly to forest restoration objectives, and what does this indicate about optimizing the impact of limited resources for silvicultural intervention?   \nApproach Since 1999 FIA has operated an extensive nationally-consistent forest inventory designed to monitor changes in forests across all lands in the US. The program measures forest variables on a network of permanent ground plots that are systematically distributed at a rate of approximately 1 plot per 2428 hectares across the US. In Oregon and Washington, sampling has been intensified on some lands (i.e., primarly national forests), often yielding estimators with higher precision within small domains (i.e., small spatial domains and/or rare forest attributes) relative to other states. Importantly, ground plots are remeasured every 10-years in the western US, and approximately 14,000 forested plots have been remeasured in Oregon and Washington to date.\nUsing the FIA plot network, we derive a design-based estimator of forest structural stage distributions (and subsequently restoration need) that is directly comparable to the model-based estimator used by and DeMeo et al., 2015. First, we classify FIA plots into one of five mutually exclusive structural classes using on an algorithm first presented in Huago et al., 2015. We then apply post-stratified estimators implemented in the rFIA R package to estimate total and proportion forest land area within each structural classes along with associated measures of uncertainty (i.e., variance of the estimator). Treating reference conditions as known values, we then apply a \u0026ldquo;restoration needs\u0026rdquo; algorithm described in Huago et al., 2015 to estimate total restoration need within classified domains (e.g., HUC units, ownership types, etc). The purpose of this \u0026ldquo;restoration needs\u0026rdquo; algorithm is to shift land area from over-represented structural classes (relative to historic conditions) to under-represented classes. Importantly, these shifts do not affect the variance of the estimator of total forest land area as we are simply adding/subtracting scalars in each case. That is, the variance of the estimator of total forest restoration need is exactly equal to that of the estimator of total forest land area using this approach, as reference conditions are not treated as random variables but as fixed, known boundaries.\nSimilarly, we derive an estimator of average annual change in forest restoration need by redefining FIA\u0026rsquo;s current area inventories to include only remeasured plots. In short, this allows us to estimate structural stage distributions at two points in time using an identical sample of FIA plots, and hence estimate temporal change in forest restoration need. Further, we can directly attribute changes in structural stage distributions to natural forest disturbances, silvicultural treatments, and succession (transition in structural class in the absence of disturbance/treatment) using disturbance codes collected by FIA field crews. Estimated change in structural stage distributions arising from such processes can then be used in our \u0026ldquo;restoration needs\u0026rdquo; algorithm to determine the degree to which natural disturbance, silvicultural treatment, and succession have contributed to restoration objectives within classified domains.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"5ad6df00432d7527233aee048a93a4f7","permalink":"/project/rn_gnn_fia/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/rn_gnn_fia/","section":"project","summary":"Widespread fire suppression (early 20th century to present day) and intensive tree harvesting (19th to early 20th century) have shifted the composition and structure of many western forest landscapes beyond their historic range of variability.

As white-tailed deer display heterogenous social structure at the population level, we expect the assumption of homogenous contact structure inherent to many disease models may result in biased representations of disease dynamics. To advance understanding of how heterogeneity in contact structure may influence the dynamics of CWD in Michigan, we will: (1) characterize the spatial, temporal, and demographic factors affecting inter-individual contact rates and individual connectedness in white-tailed deer populations; and (2) develop network-based disease models to simulate disease-host systems and assess the influence of heterogenous contact structure on disease dynamics. We will obtain GPS data from a white-tailed deer movement study in the region of Michigan where CWD is known to occur, and infer inter-individual contacts as an overlap in space (\u0026lt; 10m) and time (within 30 minutes). We will employ Bayesian linear mixed-effects models to assess how various demographic, spatial, and temporal factors affect inter-individual contact rates and social network connectivity. We will then simulate white-tailed deer social networks with similar structures to those observed, and employ spatiotemporal network-based disease models to assess the influence of host social structure on the emergence and spread of CWD. Understanding how social connectivity varies across host demographics will allow managers to focus resources towards removal of individuals at high-risk of spreading disease, and our disease modeling will help define risks and uncertainty associated with management interventions that impact host contact structures.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d7b0278e031bbd3d6a9d8b6cbe88f3b7","permalink":"/project/networkdisease/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/networkdisease/","section":"project","summary":"Inter-individual contact is a key element affecting the transmission of infectious disease, and variation in contact structure can affect the probability, magnitude, and persistence of disease outbreaks.

Understanding the spread of CWD within this context has been a goal of state wildlife managers.","tags":null,"title":"Quantifying landscape connectivity between locations of CWD detection","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"036acf42082c4b1848b0e37b71df4d6e","permalink":"/project/rfia/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/rfia/","section":"project","summary":"An R package for estimating forest variables with the Forest Inventory and Analysis Database.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"rFIA: Unlocking the FIA Database in R","type":"project"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":" Create a free website with Academic using Markdown, Jupyter, or RStudio.

FIA hosts one of the largest ecological datasets in the world, though its complexity limits access for many potential users. rFIA is an R package designed to simplify the estimation of forest attributes using data collected by the FIA Program. Specifically, rFIA improves access to the spatio-temporal estimation capacity of the FIA Database via space–time indexed summaries of forest variables within user-defined population boundaries (e.g., geographic, temporal, biophysical). The package implements multiple design-based estimators, and has been validated against official estimates and sampling errors produced by the FIA Program. We demonstrate the utility of rFIA by assessing changes in abundance and mortality rates of ash (Fraxinus spp.) populations in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan following the establishment of emerald ash borer (_Agrilus planipennis_).","tags":null,"title":"rFIA: An R package for estimation of forest attributes with the US Forest Inventory and Analysis database","type":"publication"}]
